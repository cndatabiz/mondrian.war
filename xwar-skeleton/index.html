    <h1>Welcome to X-Mondrian!</h1>
    <p>
      X-Mondrian is a distribution of the Mondrian (R)OLAP engine.
      It combines 
      <ul>
        <li>Binaries and documentation built from the open source Mondrian project</li>
        <li>Configuration files to control mondrian operation and logging</li> 
        <li>Configuration files to deploy mondrian to a servlet container (like Tomcat, Jetty, etc.)</li>
        <li>A web-client library to access mondrian using XML/A (along with resourcs like API documentation, code samples)</li>
        <li>Sample data and a few actual mondrian web-client applications</li>
      </ul>
      X-Mondrian packages all these items into a single .WAR (web archive) file 
      which is then easily deployable to a servlet container,    
      like Apache Tomcat, Eclipse Jetty or Tiny Webserver (to name just a few).
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of X-Mondrian is to quickly get up and running with a 
      fully functional Mondrian instance that is accessible through a 
      XML for Analysis (XML/A) web service. 
      All you need to do is deploy the .WAR file in whatever way is appropriate for your servlet container.
      After that, you can immediately explore Mondrian by playing with the sample applications and data,
      without any additional manual configuration.
